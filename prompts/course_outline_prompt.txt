TOPIC: {topic}

=== YOUR MISSION ===
Create a comprehensive, professionally-structured course outline that transforms complete beginners into confident practitioners. The course should be engaging, practical, and build skills progressively from foundational concepts to advanced applications.

=== DETAILED DESIGN PRINCIPLES ===

1. LEARNING PROGRESSION
   - Start with "Why this matters" to establish relevance and motivation
   - Build from concrete basics to abstract concepts
   - Each module should naturally lead to the next
   - Avoid knowledge gaps - ensure prerequisites are covered first
   - End with capstone projects or real-world applications

2. MODULE STRUCTURE (Generate 5-6 modules)
   - Each module represents a major learning milestone
   - Module titles should be descriptive and achievement-focused
   - Aim for 60-90 minutes of learning per module
   - Balance theory with hands-on practice

3. SUBTOPIC DESIGN (3-6 subtopics per module)
   - Each subtopic should be atomic - covering one clear concept
   - Titles must be specific and searchable (good for YouTube tutorials)
   - Include both "what" and "how" topics
   - Mix conceptual understanding with practical skills
   - Use action verbs: "Building", "Creating", "Understanding", "Implementing"

4. PRACTICAL FOCUS
   - At least 30% of subtopics should be hands-on or application-focused
   - Include real-world examples and use cases
   - Where applicable, include project-based subtopics
   - Reference industry-standard tools and practices

5. LEARNER-CENTRIC APPROACH
   - Assume motivated beginners with no prior knowledge
   - Address common pain points and misconceptions
   - Provide clear learning objectives for each section
   - Ensure topics are relevant to modern practices

=== CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING ===
Before generating the course outline, systematically analyze:

1. FUNDAMENTALS ANALYSIS
   - What core concepts are absolutely essential?
   - What terminology must learners master first?
   - What common misconceptions should we address early?
   - What prerequisites (if any) should we acknowledge?

2. PROGRESSION MAPPING
   - What's the most natural learning sequence?
   - Which concepts build upon each other?
   - Where should hands-on practice be introduced?
   - How do we maintain engagement throughout?

3. PRACTICAL APPLICATION
   - What can learners build or create with this knowledge?
   - What real-world problems does this solve?
   - What projects would reinforce learning?
   - What tools or platforms are industry-standard?

4. SCOPE & DEPTH BALANCE
   - How do we cover breadth without overwhelming?
   - Which topics deserve deeper exploration?
   - What can we reference vs. teach in detail?
   - How do we make this achievable for beginners?

5. MODERN RELEVANCE
   - What are current best practices?
   - What's trending or in-demand in this field?
   - What outdated approaches should we avoid?
   - How does this connect to career opportunities?
